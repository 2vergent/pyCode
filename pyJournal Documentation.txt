* pyJournal, a clean and elegant Journal, is written in python.
* It runs on multiple platforms with ease and maintains all your journal entries in a neat way 
  which can be accessed by you anytime.
* With just a few commands to remember, it can't get easier than this.

* There are two profiles:
	1. @Root: This profile is used to login or signup

* Commands for @root:

	3. clear: Clears the screen. Trust me, you might use this a lot
	4. kill: Quits pyjournal instantly

	2. check: Asks for a date to check previous entries in your journal

* Known issues:
        1. Compatibility with macOS is still questionable
        2. Even though the data stored in the files is encrypted end-to-end,
           the files can be accessed by anyone and changed by anyone
